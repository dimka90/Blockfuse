Questions:
How would you store passwords securely?

Answer
Hashing is the process of converting a password into a fixed-length string of characters, which is typically a hash code. Hashing is a one-way function, meaning itâ€™s computationally infeasible to reverse the process and retrieve the original password.
Use a cryptographic hash function such as 
1)bcrypt,
2)Argon2
3)Sha-256

Explain the process of generating and validating a JWT.
Generating a JWT
Header:

1)The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.

2).The payload contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data
3)Validating a JWT
Receive the Token:
When a client sends a JWT, it is usually included in the HTTP Authorization header.

4) To decode and validate the JWT, you need the secret key that was used to sign the token. This step verifies the integrity of the token and extracts the payload.
