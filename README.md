Two Sum Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order. Example 1: Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 Output: [0,1] Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1]. Example 2: Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6 Output: [1,2] Example 3: Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6 Output: [0,1] Fuzz data: [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5], target =-8 [0, 4, 3, 0], target = 0 Constraints: 2 <= nums.length <= 104-109 <= nums[i] <= 109-109 <= target <= 109 Only one valid answer exists.

2. Task: Implement a user authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The system should allow users to register, log in, and access protected routes. Questions: How would you store passwords securely? Explain the process of generating and validating a JWT. How would you implement role-based access control for different API endpoints?
